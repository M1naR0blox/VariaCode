# VariaCode

VariaCode is a programming language so hard to use i couldnt even make a Guess the Number, modify the code

# Where was it made?

So you can start making your own code....

i used Python to make it

and IT IS not so TERRIBLE AS BEFORE.

# How do i code with it on a different project?

Create your project on the same location as variacode.py and KABOOM, you got it
PS: soon VariaCode will be downloadable with #PIP
